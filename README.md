Introduction
------------

[Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)) is a cross-platform application framework that is used for developing application software that can be run on various software and hardware platforms with little or no change in the underlying codebase.

[Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)) (often referred to as golang) is a programming language created at Google.

This package allows you to write Qt applications entirely in Go and makes deploying them later very easy.

Status
------

Almost all Qt functions and classes are accessible from Go and you should be able to find everything you need to build fully featured applications.

(A special exception are the WebEngine/WebView packages, these aren't available for Windows yet.)
